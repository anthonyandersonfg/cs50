# My cs50 Roadmap

I started the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course and decided to document my entire evolution process during this journey, to track my learnings and encourage other students to do the same.

## Weak 0
### Lecture 0

  * What is [Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#what-in-computer-science)
    - In short, it is the process of solving problems!

  * [Binary System](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#binary)
    - Which is the language in which the computer communicates. Taking data and summarizing it to 1's and 0's.

  * [Representing data](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#representing-data)
    - Shows how the ASCII and Unicode standards are used for data representation.

  * [Algorithms](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#algorithms)
    - Step-by-step instructions for solving a problem.

  * [Pseudocode](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#pseudocode)
    - Informal syntax closer to human language to represent an algorithm.

  * [Scratch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#scratch)
    - Shows what Scratch is and how it is a great tool for those just starting to code.
