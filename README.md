# My cs50 Roadmap

I started the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course and decided to document my entire evolution process during this journey, to track my learnings and encourage other students to do the same.

## Weak 0
### Lecture 0

  * What is [Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#what-in-computer-science)
    > In short, it is the process of solving problems!

  * [Binary System](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#binary)
    > The language that computers understand. The computer takes the data and turns it into 1's and 0's.

  * [Representing data](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#representing-data)
    > Shows how the ASCII and Unicode standards are used for data representation.

  * [Algorithms](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#algorithms)
    > Step-by-step instructions for solving a problem.

  * [Pseudocode](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#pseudocode)
    > Informal syntax closer to human language to represent an algorithm.

  * [Scratch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/notes/0/#scratch)
    > Shows what Scratch is and how it is a great tool for those just starting to code.

### Problem Set 0

#### Implement your project using Scratch

The project is of your choice, it can be a game, an animation, or anything else that fits the following requirements:
- [ ] Your project must have at least **two sprites**, **at least one** of which must resemble something **other than a cat**.
- [ ] Your project must have at least **three scripts** total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- [ ] Your project must use at least **one condition**, **one loop**, and **one variable**.
- [ ] Your project must use at least **one sound**.
- [ ] Your project should be **more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture** (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be **less complex than Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game**. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

### My project

I decided to build a game!

At first, I had no idea and I started looking for something on the internet, looking for something that would activate my creativity.
And during this navigation, I saw two sprites, a ninja and a zombie. And immediately, I had an idea.

The game is simple, you are a ninja, and you cannot let the zombies touch you. To prevent them from touching you, you must throw your kunai at them.

Although simple, it was not as easy to do as I thought!
There are several conditions to be implemented, such as animating the actions, movements, and objects of the characters, adding sound effects in specific movements, and so on!

In the end everything worked out! And it made me appreciate even more the games I play on my cell phone. They seem so silly, but I felt how difficult it can be to implement these projects!

## What have I learned?

I already had some knowledge on this subject, but the lecture filled small gaps of knowledge that I had. Especially in the part of how the data is represented.
The most important lesson I learned from this week was that at some point, we will always need help, regardless of what we are doing.
I opened my eyes wide and I can see more clearly the importance of contributing to society and the community with our work!
